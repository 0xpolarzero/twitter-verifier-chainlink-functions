# chainlink-hardhat-functions-implementation

Just an implementation of a Twitter account verification tool, using an Ethereum address. This is part of a project that was initially created during the Chainlink Fall 2022 Hackathon, using Chainlink Nodes, External Adapters and Any API. It is here adapted to use the new Chainlink Functions instead of Any API.
