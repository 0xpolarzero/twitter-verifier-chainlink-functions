- The user connect with their wallet address
- When opening the 'Verify your account' modal, they are prompted to sign a message to verify their address 'isSigned = true' in 'useVerification'
- The app makes an API call with that address and the input username
  - Access to the API is restricted to the app through a secret AES 256 key (so the address is indeed the user's)
